// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

num1 = input

even = num1 % 2

if even == 0
return even
else return odd 

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

num1 = input
num2 = input
num3 = input
num4 = input
num5 = input
mynum = [num1, num2, num3, num4, num5]

total = num1 + num2 + num3 +num4 + num5
avg = total / 5

small = 0
large = 0

find smallest number
find largest number

store smallest number in small var
store largest number in large var

print "This is your average: (avg)"
print "This is the smallest number: (small)"
print "This is the largest number: (large)"
